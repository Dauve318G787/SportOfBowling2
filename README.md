## Project Description

This project is an adaptation of the Mission Demolition project from the Bond book. It implements the project as stated in the book, along with a few enhancements.

This game is very similar to Angry Birds, and likewise, it is very simple in concept. You are given a slingshot that launches projectiles, and the goal of the game is to
get one of your projectiles to hit the green goal object encased within the structure. This is done by demolishing the structure (hence the game's name), but demolishing the structure is not
the goal of the game- the goal is simply to access the goal object.

The biggest enhancement (and what makes it coolest in my opinion) is the "good ending" that I added. If a player completes all four levels in under 15 shots, they will get the good ending.
This is a challenging task, as most of the castles take quite a few attempts to reach the goal if they are not broken down correctly. A skilled player could access the goal in any of the levels
in less than 5 or so shots, but if the structures are broken down incorrectly, there will be a large amount of material blocking the goal, which will require a large number of shots to clear.
Hence, the levels are not as easy as they may seem.

A player will get 30 shots to get through the four levels that this game has. If they reach 30, they must restart and try again. Shot count does not reset between levels, so players must take care
and ensure they do not waste shots as they progress.

That's about all there is to say! Enjoy the game!
